# Wizard

> Summon strong spells to damage enemies. The elements will flow through your fingers and into the enemies cold, dead eyes as your power grips their life.

## Overview

Wizards cast spells from a distance, have strong single target and AOE damage with the added ability to inflict  debilitating curses. Their spells are restricted to the usage of a single element when they first start on their path. At level 50, they are given the opportunity to learn a second element from Dar, the Mileth dark spell master. Once mastered, they have access to all available element's spells.

## Elements

In Unora, each element has its own advantage:

- Srad (fire): Has a chance to place a burning DoT on the target
    - This effect looks like a giant fire ball on the target
- Sal (water): Has a chance to cleave additional targets next to the enemy
    - This effect looks like a blue water ball on the target
- Creag (earth): Has a chance to stun the enemy
- Athar (wind): Has a chance for your spells to do 30% more damage
    - This effect looks like sparkles on the target. Casting a second spell while active will guarantee a critical strike

These effects cannot trigger on enemies that are strong against said element.

## Changing Elements

Prior to mastering Wizard, if you aren't happy with the element you chose, you can freely switch to a different element. Note that you will need to fund the items and gold to learn all of your spells again. This can be performed at Dar in Mileth.

## Mastering

Wizards must meet the following conditions to master:

- 7,000 base HP
- 9,000 base MP
- 250,000,000 experience (which will be sacrificed)
- Magic Ink (item drop from CR20)
- Magic Scroll (item drop from CR20)
- Spells learned: Ard Cradh, Arcane Blast

## Class Dedication (subbing)

Wizards must meet the following conditions to sub:

- 6,000 base HP
- 6,000 base MP
- 60,000,000 experience (which will be sacrificed)
- 10 Strong Health Potions

19 stat points will carry over into the class you dedicate into.
