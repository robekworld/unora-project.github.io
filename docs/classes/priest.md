> Using magic to protect other sparks, you will grant blessing and heal wounds. Nothing will conquer your allies with you by their side.

## Overview

Priests are the primary support role, casting a number of buffs and heals to support their party. Prior to mastering, they have access to a pet to assist them with soloing or used in small parties for added damage and/or tanking. Upon mastering, Priests are able to specialize in either a "Light Priest" or "Dark Priest" role, furthering either their healing or damage potential.
